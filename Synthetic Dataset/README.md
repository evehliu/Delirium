# Reusable Synthetic Dataset Generation Prompt

## Hospital Delirium Summary ‚Äì First Episode per Patient

### Objective
Generate a fully synthetic dataset (no real patient data) for a Power BI dashboard focused on summarizing the first delirium episode per admitted patient, based on CAM screening events.

---

## GENERAL SPECS

- **Rows**: One row per patient (URN), up to 5,000 unique URNs
- **Patients**: Admitted only (`Admitted = 1`)
- **Time Range**: Between Jan 1, 2022 and Dec 31, 2024
- **Datetime Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`

## How to Reproduce the Datasets

To reproduce the synthetic patient datasets, you can use the provided Python script üêç `generate_datasets.py`. This script generates the üìä `EDMADMCombined`, üìä `Delirium`, and üìä `DeliriumAI` datasets based on the specifications outlined above.

### Steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `random`, `datetime`.
3. Run the `generate_datasets.py` script.
