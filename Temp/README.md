# Synthetic Patient Dataset Generation

This repository contains synthetic patient datasets for a Power BI project. The datasets are designed to simulate patient data for the purpose of analyzing delirium and related metrics. The datasets include `Delirium`, `DeliriumAI`, and `EDMADMCombined` tables.

## Dataset Purpose

The purpose of these datasets is to provide a realistic simulation of patient data for the analysis of delirium, its prediction, and related metrics. The datasets can be used to create visualizations, perform data analysis, and build predictive models in Power BI.

## Dataset Generation Logic

1. **EDMADMCombined Table**:
   - Generate 5,000 unique patient records with realistic timestamps and values.
   - Ensure logical consistency between `ArrDateTime`, `AdmDateTime`, and `DisDateTime`.

2. **Delirium Table**:
   - Randomly select 2,500 URNs from `EDMADMCombined`.
   - Generate the rest of the columns based on the selected URNs.

3. **DeliriumAI Table**:
   - Randomly select 2,500 URNs from `EDMADMCombined`.
   - Generate the rest of the columns based on the selected URNs.

## Usage for Power BI Projects

1. **Import the datasets** into Power BI.
2. **Create relationships** between the tables using the `URN` column.
3. **Build visuals and dashboards** to analyze delirium metrics, predict risk, and explore patient data.

## Example Visuals

- **Delirium Incidence**: Visualize the number of patients with confirmed delirium episodes.
- **Risk Prediction**: Analyze the accuracy of AI predictions for delirium risk.
- **Length of Stay**: Explore the length of stay for patients with and without delirium.

## Conclusion

These synthetic datasets provide a realistic simulation of patient data for analyzing delirium and related metrics. 
They are designed to be used in Power BI projects to create insightful visualizations and predictive models ðŸ“Š.
